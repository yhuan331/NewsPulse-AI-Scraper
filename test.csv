https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/economy/asia-pacific/china-economic-outlook.html,"China economic outlook, February 2023","China's management of COVID-19 saw a dramatic transformation toward the end of 2022. The infrastructure of mass PCR testing and movement tracking through telephone carriers was phased out, and the government encouraged those yet to recover from the infection to return to work. In 2023, China’s borders, which have effectively been closed for nearly three years, also reopened. Assuming adequate policy support, we expect real GDP to grow by approximately 5% this year, following a growth of 3% in 2022. We are of the view that Q4 2022 represents a cyclical low in terms of growth. There are trade-offs when it comes to loosening COVID-19–related restrictions, as was witnessed across the globe over the last two years. As long as Chinese consumers continue to gauge the impact of a flattening curve of infections, economic data could likely stay sluggish, roughly in line with the economic data for November 2022.",09 February 2023,Xu Sitao,,['https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/economy/asia-pacific/china-economic-outlook.html']

https://www.deloitte.com/au/en/services/financial-advisory/blogs/china-economic-update-potential-to-pick-up-pace-in-2023.html,China economic update: Potential to pick up pace in 2023?,"The confirmation of Xi Jinping’s third term as leader of China presents an opportunity to take stock of the world’s second largest economy. While Deloitte Access Economics expects that many developed countries may fall into recession in 2023, China has the potential to deliver stronger economic growth than seen in 2022. With a lacklustre performance in 2022, the country enters 2023 from a relatively low base and with potential for higher economic growth. The 2023 growth potential in China also stems from the fact that it isn’t seeing the same inflationary pressures as in the US and Europe, hence interest rates haven’t needed to rise (in fact they have fallen through 2022). Lower interest rates will be important for stimulating activity once COVID restrictions in China do subside. It is also likely that China’s government may employ fiscal measures to tackle economic challenges and stimulate consumer spending. Consumer sentiment has currently bottomed out but is expected to pick up in 2023 as consumers unleash pent-up demand from 2022. An increase in consumer spending in China would increase demand for Australian exports in the medium-term. However, we likely won’t see the sort of commodity demand that we did after the 2008 global financial crisis as China’s growth in 2023 may be more consumer led, rather than infrastructure and industrial led (where there is still considerable spare capacity). The outlook in 2023, though brighter than in 2022, is set against the backdrop of ongoing turmoil in China’s property market and high levels of public debt linked to property. COVID exposed cracks in the credit bubble, triggering debt defaults and placing major property developers at severe financial risk. The real estate sector represents almost a quarter of GDP and remains plagued by supply-side constraints and mortgage boycotts. Relaxed monetary policy may stimulate business investment, but the real estate downturn will likely still weigh on broader economic growth in 2023. Looking past the current crisis, China also faces structural concerns which will continue to detract from growth in the medium to long-term. With an ageing population and low fertility rates, younger families will have to increasingly front the costs of the retiring ‘baby boomer’ cohort. A short-term economic rebound will not alleviate these structural issues.",09 Nov 2022,David Rumbens,,['https://www.deloitte.com/au/en/services/financial-advisory/blogs/china-economic-update-potential-to-pick-up-pace-in-2023.html']

The article also discusses how AI can help retailers deepen customer engagement, increase productivity and cost savings, and find new growth beyond trade. The authors suggest that while AI adoption in China is less advanced than in the US, the country's high e-commerce penetration rates and strong AI research and development could accelerate its growth.","October 29, 2024","James Yang, Kelly Liu, and Melanie Sanders",,['https://www.bain.com/insights/gen-ai-can-help-retailers-defy-chinas-economic-slowdown/']
